Progress chart for week 1 of coding:

Well back here after 2 weeks and I have finally completed almost everything except React which I am gonna take my time and complete. I will focus on Python from next week 
and learn at least a 75% of Python development and I won't stop. Meanwhile, I will be working on my CSS and JS and make a stronghold over it because frontend makes a good 
impression.

Learnt a lot of backend code and as aforementioned only React is left to complete my MERN Stack. Backend code and databases seemed a lot easy to deal with personally, just 
need to work more with shells and Terminal top make myself faster at server side execution else my concept of APIs and databases are really strong, at least that's what I think 
personally. Well how much, that will be pretty much visible after a month but I need to have a strong firmhold over whatever I learnt about web dev until now. Also, I will
be thoroughly working on my Python knowledge and make myself an expert in Python.

Even though I have completed whatever I have learnt, I need to work on frontend tools, using AI for taking less time to write a code, and more database queries and have more
knowledge while handling RESTful APIs and CRUD operations and make myself a master in all of this as well as Python so that I can at least manage to work at a company or a job
next year after March is over. 

Well will keep updating you more about my progress here.

Happy Coding!! :)
